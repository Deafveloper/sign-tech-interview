title: Array Methods' Mutability
description: |
  In JavaScript, array methods can be categorized into two types: mutating and non-mutating methods. Mutating methods change the original array, while non-mutating methods return a new array without modifying the original.
  Understanding the difference between these two types of methods is crucial for writing clean and efficient code.
  This article will explore the mutability of array methods in JavaScript, providing examples and best practices for using them effectively.
  By the end of this article, you will have a clear understanding of how to work with array methods in JavaScript and how to choose the right method for your needs.
  This knowledge will help you write cleaner, more efficient code and avoid common pitfalls associated with mutating methods.
  Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this article will provide valuable insights into the mutability of array methods in JavaScript.

| Method         | Description                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `push()`       | Adds one or more elements to the **end** of the array.                        |
| `pop()`        | Removes the **last** element of the array.                                    |
| `shift()`      | Removes the **first** element of the array.                                   |
| `unshift()`    | Adds one or more elements to the **beginning** of the array.                  |
| `splice()`     | Adds, removes, or replaces elements at any index.                             |
| `sort()`       | Sorts the elements **in place** (can be unstable without a compare function). |
| `reverse()`    | Reverses the order of the array **in place**.                                 |
| `fill()`       | Fills elements in the array with a static value.                              |
| `copyWithin()` | Copies part of the array to another location **in the same array**.           |
